Game Plan:

    We are comparing two methods of massively parralel DNA sequencing

    Create a machine learning model to give us the values of call
        With more data we would have a better accuracy

    Create a code that rearranges sequence_data_biochem2
        We know there was a bug on the imaging software
        So the A, C, G, T values are paired incorrectly

        Just by looking:
            A values should be T values
            C values should be A values
            G values should be C values
            T values should be G values

    Use model on sequence_data_biochem1 and sequence_data_biochem2_revised

    Compare the accuracy of each sequence data by comparing the ref to call to find which method is more accurate
        We can also compare how many N values we received
        We can check if there is a disparity on a certain base

Notes:

    My model had an accuracy of 99.2%, so there will be a small disparity in accuracy and error calculations.
    This can be seen by comparing the original Cycle 1 accuracy and error with the codes Cycle 1 accuracy and error.
    I recommend that the research project should progress with the massively parralel DNA sequencing method used
    for sequencing_data_biochem1.csv because the average accuracy was 94.6% and the average error was 5.4%.
    The massively parralel DNA sequencing method used for sequencing_data_biochem2.csv had an average accuracy
    of 70.1% and an average error of 29.9%.

    processed_sequencing_data_biochem1.csv:
        The original accuracy for cycle 1 was 96.1%, with an error of 3.9%
        Cycle 1:
            Accuracy: 95.9%%
            Error: 4.1%%
            Amount of N values: 21
        Cycle 2:
            Accuracy: 93.3%
            Error: 6.7%
            Amount of N values: 22
        Cycle 2 had a larger disparity with Adenine compared to Cycle 1.
        In Cycle 1:
            4 Adenine references displayed Guanine, 1 Adenine references displayed Thymine,
            4 Adenine references displayed Cytosine.
        In Cycle 2:
            16 Adenine references displayed Guanine, 12 Adenine references displayed Thymine,
            9 Adenine references displayed Cytosine.

    processed_sequencing_data_biochem2_revised.csv:
        All Thymine values were incorrect.
        None of the other bases were incorrectly displaying Thymine.
        Cycle 1:
            Accuracy: 71%
            Error: 29%
            Amount of N values: 43
        Cycle 2:
            Accuracy: 69.2%
            Error: 30.8%
            Amount of N values: 43
